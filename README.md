A Btree databases in C++

<h2 align="center"> Explaintion:💡</h2>
The program build array of binary trees, and each tree you can insert data , rest what a tree you want in the array of the trees, check if the tree is a search tree, print the depth of the tree, mirror the tree (no longer search tree), compere between tow trees and print the tree you want.
(to know how to make an array of trees go to "input").

The input:
The program receives numbers following numbers are:

<p>"-1" to exit the program
<p>"0" to Boot tree
<p>"1" to add a new vertex in the tree (then you need to add what number you want to enter the number to the vertex).
<p>"2" print the smallest value in the tree.
<p>"4" print "1" if the tree is search tree and "0" if not.
<p>"5" print the depth of the tree.
<p>"6" mirror the tree.
